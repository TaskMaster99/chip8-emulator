# Chip-8 Emulator in C

This is a simple **Chip-8 emulator** written in **C**.  
I’m building this project purely for **learning purposes** and for **fun**—no production intentions here!  

## About Chip-8

Chip-8 is a **simple, interpreted programming language** from the 1970s, primarily used to run games on early home computers.  
Its simplicity makes it a popular choice for anyone wanting to learn about emulators and low-level programming.  

## Features

- Basic Chip-8 instruction set support  
- 64x32 pixel monochrome display  
- Keyboard input  
- Timers  

> ⚠️ Note: This emulator is a work in progress and may not support all features yet.

## Why I’m Doing This

- **Learning C:** Improve understanding of pointers, memory management, and low-level programming concepts.  
- **Understanding emulators:** Get hands-on experience with CPU emulation, opcode decoding, and timing.  
- **Fun:** Running classic Chip-8 games is a rewarding experience!  

## How to Build
```bash
